HARPE GAMING HOME PAGE
======================

Welcome to Harpe Gaming. We have a simple philosophy. It has three main points:

* Unplug
* Interact
* Reconnect

And that's it. We believe that the best games are the ones 
that bring people together through shared experiences. With 
all due respect to our video gamer friends, you can't always get
that from a computer screen. Sometimes you need the 
intimate approach of sitting face-to-face around 
a common table with the soda and chips at your elbow.

We are a local board and card game store located in the 
heart of Morgantown near the campus. We carry 
hundreds of games and puzzles, including educational games, family games, card games, historical 
simulations, role-playing games, and so much more. 
If you remember a great game from your youth, we 
probably have it in our antiques collection. If we don't, we know where we can get it.

We're more than just a place to buy games. We celebrate 
gaming and the company of good friends. 
Our game room is free for all to us. Sit down, pick out 
a game from our demo library and start playing. 
We sponsor tournaments, challenges, and special 
social events. You'll always find a game to play.

We're always on the lookout for the best new games. We 
publish periodic reviews of new titles. Just out 
our reviews of Towers and Temples and Alliance; both 
new this month at Harpe Gaming.

TOWERS AND TEMPLES PAGE
=======================

Review of Towers and Temples

Game ID:	bg210
List Price:	$17.73
Media	Board: Game
Release Date:	October 21, 2017
Age:	10+
Players:	2 - 8
Time:	30 - 60 minutes



--------------------


This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must 
carefully choose his or her roles and 
the strategies can quickly change with the turn 
of a card. However the level of randomness is 
just right and cunning and resourcefulness can 
overcome bad luck (if given time.) I do not 
recommend this game unless there are at least 4 
players; less than that reduces the intrigue 
and some of the game appeal.

Tedious and Confusing
---------------------
The list of war simulation games is long. All of them 
share similar features including the 
formation of temporary Alliance and battles simulated 
through random draws of a deck or the 
roll of the die. Alliance offers very little that 
is new or innovative in that regard.

We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing. 
In fact, I dare say we spent more time 
reading and rereading the rule book than actually 
playing the game. If you want to read a 
book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu.

Board Game Review (http://www.example.com/bgreview)


Decent Game but Many are Better
-------------------------------
Alliance is a good war simulation game. We found the 
game play to be robust and engaging. The 
rules are long and drawn out but, for anyone with 
experience in this class of board games, there 
is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We 
think the battle simulation cards are some of 
the best we have encountered.

All of that being said, the competition for this type 
of game is fierce. There are a lot of 
established titles with loyal clients. We're not 
exactly sure where Alliance fits in with 
that group. It's a good game, but not good enough 
to draw our attention away from games like 
Battle Tested and Global Conflict.

Fun and Challenging
-------------------
Alliance is fun game and is sure to appeal to 
war game enthusiasts. We think it offers several new 
ideas that we're surprised have not been utilized in other simulation games. The card system and the investment options give the game a "real world" feel.

Things We Liked
* Variety of Battle Scenarios
* Flexible Rules and Setup
* Detail and Historical Accuracy
* Wealth of Expansion Packs

Things We Hated
* Long and Complicated Rule Book
* Setup takes too Long

This is a great game for anyone 16 years or older. Younger players may have trouble with the rules and may be bored.
