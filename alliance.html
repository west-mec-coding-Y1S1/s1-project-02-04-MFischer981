               Alliance challenges you and your opponents to decide 
            the outcome. As one of the world powers 
            battling for supremacy you must lead your country's
             military drive; but you can't do it alone. 
            You have to form alliances and then betray your 
            allies before they betray you! 
            </p>
            <p>
               Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity
             of the strike. Will it be a bombing 
            raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an invasion 
            with land forces and tanks? Plan your attack, 
            move into enemy territory with your forces and win 
            the conflict.  
            </p>
           <p>
              The economic destiny of your nation is also at stake. 
            Buy armaments and develop secret 
            weapons from your country's economic funds and 
            natural reserves, but be sure to save 
            something for the future.

                The list of war simulation games is long. All of them 
                share similar features including the 
                formation of temporary Alliance and battles simulated 
                through random draws of a deck or the 
                roll of the die. Alliance offers very little that 
                is new or innovative in that regard.
                <br><br>
                We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing. 
                In fact, I dare say we spent more time 
                reading and rereading the rule book than actually 
                playing the game. If you want to read a 
                book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu.

                Alliance is a good war simulation game. We found the 
                game play to be robust and engaging. The 
                rules are long and drawn out but, for anyone with 
                experience in this class of board games, there 
                is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We 
                think the battle simulation cards are some of 
                the best we have encountered.
                <br><br>
                All of that being said, the competition for this type 
                of game is fierce. There are a lot of 
                established titles with loyal clients. We're not 
                exactly sure where Alliance fits in with 
                that group. It's a good game, but not good enough 
                to draw our attention away from games like 
                Battle Tested and Global Conflict.

          Alliance is fun game and is sure to appeal to 
        war game enthusiasts. We think it offers several new 
        ideas that we're surprised have not been utilized in other simulation games. The card system and the investment options give the game a "real world" feel.
